According to the 2010 census the San Francisco Bay area has a population of 7,150,739. Of that population 1,141,862 are between the ages of 5 and 17. In that age range I estimate that 1 in 5 is a gamer, making 228,372 of them gamers. 

There are 4,682,837 people between the ages of 18 and 64. Within that age group I would estimate that 1 in 20 of them are gamers, making 234,141 more gamers. 

There are 878,229 people over the age of 65. I would estimate that 1 in ever 100,000 of them is a gamer, making about 9 more gamers.

With those estimations, I would estimate the number of gamers in the San Francisco bay area to be 462522.
